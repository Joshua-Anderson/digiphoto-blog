I chose green as my color for the creative assignment.

I chose green because green is the color of life and is really prevelant as it starts to become fall.

The opposite color of green on the color wheel is red. This picture is by Griffin Audy, and I think it realy pairs well with my green color, as the pictures blend well togther.
