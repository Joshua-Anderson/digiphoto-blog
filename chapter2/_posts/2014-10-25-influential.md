I was inspired this month by the work of [Wendy Gradwell](https://www.flickr.com/photos/oldfolky/)

She took an amazing photo of her kitten. I really was inspired by the framing, depth of field, and the way she perfectly potrayed the cat.

Repliating her style, I tried to take my own picture of my cat. I think I was successful in replicating her style, but I believe that her photo came out a little bit better.
