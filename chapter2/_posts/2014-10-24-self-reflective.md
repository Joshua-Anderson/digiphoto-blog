There is big gap between a casual photo and art. Here I have two pictures of my cat, one is casual and one is art.

This photo isn't art becuase it is just a quick picture. It isn't well framed, and the lighting isn't great, with half of my cat's body in the shade and the other half in the sun. I took the picture becuase my cat was looking cute in the picture, not becuase it was actually a good shot.

This second picture is art becuase it is nicely framed. I planned how to take this pictuer with a nice backdrop and waited for my cat to look the right direction. It has much better lighting and it was edited to make the exposure even better than the origonal photo.
