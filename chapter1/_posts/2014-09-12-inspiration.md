One photographer that has really inspired me is [John Phillips](https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnphillips1).
Here are some of my favorite photos of his.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnphillips1/15165052976" title="Early Mountain Light by John Phillips, on Flickr"><img class="post-image" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5567/15165052976_0b5d38dd28_k.jpg" alt="Early Mountain Light"></a>

I like this photo because of the refelections in the water with a mountainious background. I will use the framing style of this photo in my work.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnphillips1/14343995825" title="Red Kites by John Phillips, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3901/14343995825_a6cfdd20dd_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1366" alt="Red Kites"></a>

I like this image because of the sharp contrast between the diving kite and the blurry background. I will use his shap foreground-blurry background style in my photos.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnphillips1/6781263085" title="Eberhard Automatic Watch Movement by John Phillips, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6781263085_bac3c20913_b.jpg" width="1024" height="682" alt="Eberhard Automatic Watch Movement"></a>

I chose this photo because it caught my eye with the perfectly captured complexity and detail in the watch. I want to use his macro photography techniques in my photos.

If you like his work as much as I do, please [like some of his photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnphillips1).
