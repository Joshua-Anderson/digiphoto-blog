For my technical section, I experimented with macro images with aperture priority.
I focused the image to keep the texture of the surface very detailed but the background blured.
I also used lightroom to do lens corrections and to adjust the colors.

Since the bench was in the shadows, I had to use a slow shutter speed on the bench. I took several pictures until I managed to figure out how to brance the camera to keep it from wobbling.

I had to play with the aperture to capture the white flowers without over exposing them.

I played with the saturation in lightroom to make the track more vivid and red than it came out in my picture.

I edited this photo in lightroom to give the grass a greener tone than was captured by my camera.
