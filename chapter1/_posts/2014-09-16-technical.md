For my technical section, I exparemented with macro images with apature priority.
I focused the image to keep the texture of the surface very detailed but the background blured.
I also used lightroom to edit these picutres to do lense corrections and adjust the colors.

I had to play with the apature to capture the white flowres without over exposing them.

I edited this photo in lightroom to give the grass a greener tone than was captured by my camera.

As always, you can contact me to get different formats of these images.
