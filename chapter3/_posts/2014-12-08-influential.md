This month, I was inspired by the photographer Michael Kenna.

These are some of my favorite by Michael Kenna:

I liked the picture becuase the exciting sky contrasted nicely with the sand dunes.

I liked this picture becuase of the simplistic but interesting nature of the torri gate blending with the ground and the background.

This is a picture that I took in the style of Michael Kenna:
