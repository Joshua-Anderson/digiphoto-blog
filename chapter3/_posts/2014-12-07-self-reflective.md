Over the past few months, I have grown quite a bit as a photographer. These are few of the pictures I think show my growth as a photographer.

<img class="post-image" src="/images/tree.jpg" alt="">

I think that this picture demonstrates my ability to use depth of field to get an artistic efect. It also demonstrates good framing with the sharp tree ading contrast to the blury background.

<img class="post-image" src="/images/snow.jpg" alt="">

I think that photo demonstrates my ability to frame a picture well, using the river to draw the viewers attention in a path accross the photo.

<img class="post-image" src="/images/lamp.jpg" alt="">

I think that this photo demonstates good depth of field, highlighting the lamp in the foreground. It also shows good use of camera raw to get good color out of a photo.
