I used the lomo action to edit this flower picture I took.

Before lomo action:

<img class="post-image" src="/images/action-before.jpg" alt="">

After lomo action:

<img class="post-image" src="/images/action-after.jpg" alt="">

The lomo action gave my picture a much more interesting color set to look at.
