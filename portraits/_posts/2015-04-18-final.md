Here is my final Portait image. It used the same base image from my contact sheet, but I worked on photoshop to improve it in many ways.
I sharpened, burned, dodged, and removed stray hairs and blemishes from the picture.

The accompanying peom is:

I am from hot chocolate on a winter day

from Hershey's and strawberries

I am from the cozy beds

warm, soft

It feels like clouds

I am from the daffodils so graceful and free

the wild roses

wandering so happily

I'm from the camping trips and joyfulness

from Diana and Tor and Josh

I'm from the adventure and laughter

From easter bunnies a tooth fairies

I'm from faithfulness

hopefulness

I'm from Palo Alto

chocolate and oranges

From the caring mother singing me to sleep

the helpful father teaching me math

the hallway of pictures

I am from happiness, warmth, flowers, and fun
