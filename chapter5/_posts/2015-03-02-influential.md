I chose [Steve Bond](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stevebond) for my influential photographer this month.

I liked his work becuase if shows amazing use of lighting. He used HDR and others exposure techniques to capture a very large range of light, giving his pictures dynamic, vivd colors and contrast.
